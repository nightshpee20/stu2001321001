      <h1>Meet the Jack of All Trades, Master of None!</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, World! I'm Dzhem Bekir, the eternal apprentice. After a whirlwind
        career trying everything from being Santa's helper to working with the
        Space Program for Earth's Defense, and yes, even a brief stint with
        Satan himself, I've landed here. My talent? Being so untalented that
        it's almost a talent! Join me on this roller coaster of epic
        misadventures.
